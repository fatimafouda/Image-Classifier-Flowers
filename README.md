# Image Classifier for Flowers using PyTorch

This project is part of the * Udacity Data Science Nanodegree * <br>
In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 

## Data:
We'll be using (this dataset)[http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html] of 102 flower categories



##Steps:
1. Load and preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier using a pretrained model
3. Saving the checkpoint
4. Testing the model/checkpoint
5. Creating the a python app to run from the terminal
